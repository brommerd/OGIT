# Integration / Decisions / Audit

## Overview

Audit-and-evidence records that MUST survive Right-to-Erasure. Vertices here
reference subjects only by stable pseudonymous identifiers that survive erasure;
they carry no raw PII.

Entities: ActionInvocation.

- Right-to-Erasure operations MUST NOT touch this namespace.
- A record derived from a Subject's PII (e.g. a target-resource reference, or a
  source id) MUST be pseudonymised before persistence -- the survive-erasure
  guarantee is on the structural record, not on raw source content.

**Audit-forever applies to streams, not vertices.** ActionInvocation is
ephemeral (hard-deleted after its terminal state); the audit guarantee is on the
timeseries / audit streams keyed by it, which outlive the vertex. Vertex
hard-deletion is housekeeping, not a Right-to-Erasure event.
